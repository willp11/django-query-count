# Decorator to count number of database queries and execution time in Django

I made this repo just to store somewhere this awesome decorator made by Goutom Roy, found in his article https://betterprogramming.pub/django-select-related-and-prefetch-related-f23043fd635d .

Just apply this decorator to a function inside a Django project to get some nice insights to help increase your application's performance.
